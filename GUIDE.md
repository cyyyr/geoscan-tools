# Demodulating images from Geoscan-Edelveis
###### By SA2KNG 2023-01-03

This is a quick guide on two ways to demodulate images from 
[geoscan-edelveis](https://dashboard.satnogs.org/d/9DnJFFO4z/geoscan-edelveis).

What you will need is the frames from one image dump, either by observing the satellite yourself or getting the frames
from other [observations](https://network.satnogs.org/observations/?future=0&bad=0&failed=0&norad=53385).<br>
Please see the [community thread](https://community.libre.space/t/geoscan-edelveis-mission/9644) for more info on this.

The scripts required are found in this repo, additionally you will need 
[gr_satellites](https://gr-satellites.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation_intro.html).<br> 
Optionally [GNU parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/) 
and [sox](https://sox.sourceforge.net/) depending on methods and versions.

### Method #1 - download frames from SatNOGS DB
This relies on the stations having demodulated the frames, this is not the case when I'm writing this guide, as the 
stations need [additional demodulation](https://github.com/kng/satnogs_gr-satellites) software running to provide these.

Log in to DB first, then go to the DB [Data Export](https://db.satnogs.org/satellite/QNCD-8954-6090-5430-2718#data) and 
select the timespan needed for the image youâ€™re interested in, getting all the frames will take some time thou. 
This CSV will be emailed to your address. Download this to a working directory, in this example `~/geoscan/`.<br>

To select only the frames of the timestamp of interest, we can use grep to do this:<br>
`grep '^2023-01-02 23' QNCD-8954-6090-5430-2718-1481-20230103T094910Z-week.csv > 2023-01-02_23.csv`<br>

This results in a 840K csv that has all that is needed, a bunch of duplicates as well. We now just run process on it:<br>
`process_simple.py 2023-01-02_23.csv` which results in `Writing image to: 2023-01-02_23.jpg`.<br>

That's it, when the images are separated in time and all the frames are available, this is all that is needed.

### Method #2 - download audio from single observation
First an example of a single station, the incredible Dwingeloo [@radiotelescoop](https://twitter.com/radiotelescoop).
Open the [observation page](https://network.satnogs.org/observations/6969073/) and download the audio at the bottom left
to a working directory, for example `~/geoscan/6969073/`.<br>
Then process it with audiodemod in fast mode, it searches for all files named `satnogs_*.ogg` so it's important to keep
other observation ogg separate:<br>
```commandline
audiodemod.sh 
Found 1 files to process...
running fast demodulation
satnogs_6969073_2023-01-03T08-39-08.ogg
```
This results in a bunch of files, and it's the .csv we want, so run this through process_simple:<br>
```commandline
process_simple.py satnogs_6969073_2023-01-03T08-39-08.csv
Writing image to: satnogs_6969073_2023-01-03T08-39-08.jpg
```
If the observation is this complete this is all that is needed, but the next example uses a lot of stations to possibly 
collect all frames.

### Method #3 - download all observations in selected timeframe 
This method has the advantage of getting frames from stations not demodulating this in the first place, 
althou it is a tiny bit less sensitive due to the lossy ogg format.

Make a working directory for the observation data, for example: `~/geoscan/2023-01-03_08/` and enter it.<br>
Run the audio downloader with either the transmitter ID or NORAD and the timestamp it was sent:<br>
`satnogs_fetch_audio.py -u RzkypM3s5zPQf2PC9iY8Ki -s 2023-01-03T08:00:00Z -d 60`
